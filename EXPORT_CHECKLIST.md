## üèóÔ∏è Build Process

### Automated Build
```bash
# Quick build using script
./build-windows.sh
```

### Manual Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for Windows
npm run build:win
```

## üì¶ Expected Output Files

After successful build, you should have in `dist/` directory:

### Installer Version (Recommended)
- **File**: `Dropi Research App Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **Type**: NSIS Installer
- **Size**: ~150-200MB
- **Features**: Desktop shortcut, Start menu, Uninstaller

### Portable Version
- **File**: `Dropi Research App 1.0.0.exe` 
- **Type**: Standalone Executable
- **Size**: ~200-250MB
- **Features**: No installation required, run anywhere

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Before Distribution
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Icons display correctly in file explorer
- [ ] App launches on Windows machine
- [ ] All core features work:
  - [ ] Login system
  - [ ] Product scraping
  - [ ] Product viewer
  - [ ] Product details
  - [ ] Findings management
  - [ ] Trend validation
  - [ ] AI prompt generation

### Performance Testing
- [ ] App starts within 30 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage under 500MB
- [ ] No crashes during normal use
- [ ] Data persistence works correctly

## üìã Distribution Options

### Option 1: Professional Distribution
1. **Code sign the executable** (recommended for commercial use)
2. **Create installer package** with custom branding
3. **Set up auto-updater** for seamless updates

### Option 2: Simple Distribution
1. **Share the installer/portable exe** directly
2. **Provide installation instructions**
3. **Include system requirements**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Considerations

### Windows Defender
- Unsigned executables may trigger Windows Defender warnings
- This is normal for new/unsigned software
- Users can click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 500MB free space
- **Internet**: Required for product scraping

### File Size
- Large file size is normal for Electron apps
- Includes complete Node.js runtime
- Consider this when distributing via email/download

## üö¢ Ready for Export!

Once the build completes successfully, your Windows executable will be ready for distribution. The app includes all dependencies and can run on any compatible Windows machine without requiring Node.js or additional software installation.

### Next Steps After Build:
1. Test the executable on a Windows machine
2. Create installation/usage documentation
3. Plan distribution method (direct download, installer, etc.)
4. Consider code signing for professional deployment

## üìû Support Information

If users encounter issues:
- Check Windows version compatibility
- Ensure antivirus isn't blocking the app
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Try running as administrator (if needed)

The app stores data in the user's AppData directory on Windows, ensuring proper permissions and persistence.
