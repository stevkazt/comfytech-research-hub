3. **IPC Handler** (`main/index.js`)
   - Added `update-product-details` IPC handler
   - Includes debug logging for product updates
   - Handles API communication with error handling

4. **Edit Modal Function** (`product-details/product-actions.js`)
   - `showEditProductModal()` function creates and manages edit modal
   - Pre-populates all current product data

### **🧪 Test Products Created**

## **🐛 Debug Features**

All edit operations include comprehensive debug logging:
